## Managing Deformation: A Step Towards Higher Robot Autonomy
We are in the process of migrating the workshop page to its official site at [Managing Deformation: A Step Towards Higher Robot Autonomy](https://www.lirmm.fr/recherche/equipes/idh/DefWorkshop)

# Objectives
The capability to interact with deformable objects largely extends the autonomy of robots to perform complex tasks such as handling cables, shaping food materials, picking up agricultural products, performing surgical operations, folding clothes etc. These advanced skills can significantly contribute to the deployment of consumer robots, which is the central theme of the IROS 2020.

However, taking into account deformation introduces new challenges, in particular:
- The complication of **sensing deformation**
- The curse of **infinite dimensionality** of the deformation configuration
- The complexity of **high nonlinearity** in modeling the deformation

New paradigms are needed to tackle these challenges. Therefore, the aim of  this workshop is to discuss new research prospects considering the object’s deformation in various robotic applications.

We can sense deformation with different modalities, e.g. force/tactile measurements provide crucial information for grasping and manipulation, but, this feedback is only locally available. Vision, on the other hand, offers a global picture of shape deformation but is subjected to noise and occlusion. We seek **1) methods to robustly sense deformation**. Then, to address the problem of infinite dimensionality, we are interested in **2) compact feedback features for characterizing deformation**. Another possible direction is **3) exploiting environmental contact for reducing the deformation dimensions**. As for the high nonlinearity problem, we are interested in **4) data-driven/model-based/hybrid approaches to model deformation for control**.

We propose a workshop to present and discuss new perspectives in managing deformation as a step towards higher robot autonomy. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers who have common interests in working with deformable objects in robotic applications. The previously-presented challenges and possible directions of research are not exhaustive. The organizers encourage participants to propose new challenges and solutions in the scope of managing deformation. The workshop will also be open to paper submission, and the final schedule will be adapted depending on the quantity and quality of the submissions. We will organize a poster session of the submitted papers to ease interaction and discussion between participants. At the end of the workshop, we will invite speakers to participate in a conclusive round table discussion.
